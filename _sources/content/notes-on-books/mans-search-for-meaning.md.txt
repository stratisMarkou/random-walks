# Man's Search for Meaning

## TLDR
Finding meaning in life is essential. It's meaning that brings fulfilment in times of happiness but also in times of trouble - when unavoidable misfortune befalls us, we can bear it with pride and perseverance. Frankl uses the term "meaning" to refer to a sense of responsibility, duty and purpose. It is the state of holding yourself accountable for your actions, especially with regard to how you affect others.

## Summary and thoughts
Victor Frankl was a Jewish doctor who survived the Nazi concentration camps. His book "Man's Search for Meaning" is composed of three chapters: the first is an account of his experiences in imprisonment and forced labour. The second and third chapters have a more analytic flavour where Frankl draws on his accounts to expand on his thesis and relate it to how the modern person - or anyone for that matter - can be helped by seeing the meaning in their lives. [Logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy) is an approach to psychotherapy (developed by Frankl) that is based on the idea of seeing the meaning in one's life and regarding oneself as a responsible agent in relation to this meaning and within their circumstances.


Frankl's retelling of the crimes committed in concentration camps, the debasement of humans and sheer extent of torture that was suffered there, are difficult to grasp without reading his narrative. In short, distinct behaviours emerged between the prisoners, differentiated by the way they chose to react to their surroundings, and behave in relation to other prisoners. Kapos were prisoners who chose to torture their compatriots with even greater zeal than many nazi guards, to gain preferential treatment but also to exercise their sadist compulsions. Other prisoners were completely overwhelmed, lost their will to live and eventually perished. Lastly, others who saw it their duty to bear their unavoidable burden and took it as their responsibility to revive others' spirits at times of despair. To the last group, their choice to see their responsibility as a source of meaning, granted them a sense of righteousness and even sustained them through the most difficult periods of their imprisonment.

As I read it, Frankl regards meaning as a necessary condition for fulfillment or eudaimonia. He points out that even in conditions of great (relative) affluence, many people claim to be suffering by a lack of meaning in their lives. The challenging thing to negotiate with all this is that one has to set the goalpost (what meaning is) and kick the ball too (act in accordance to this meaning). Doing both simultaneously can be tricky, and this meaning has to be deeply rooted in inner values. Articulating the source of meaning at any given point in time, with full honesty to oneself is challenging but important.
