# Welcome

## About

Welcome to Random Walks! This is an archive of explorations, in the convex
 hull of Inference, Probability, Optimisation and Physics. I am putting this
  together to keep track of the things I study.

## Modes under exploration

- Notes on the book *An Introduction to Probability* by Grimmett and Welsh.
- Approximate inference for Gaussian Processes.
- Stochastic processes and stochastic differential equations.
- Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models: A reproduction of [David MacKay's PhD thesis](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/thesis.pdf).
- The Neural Process family: [Conditional Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01613) (CNPs), [Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622) (NPs) and [Attentive Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05761) (ANPs).
- Probabilistic methods for Reinforcement Learning, like [PILCO](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpd37/publications/pami_final_w_appendix.pdf).
