# Welcome

## About

Welcome to Random Walks! This is an archive of explorations, in the convex hull of Inference, Probability, Optimisation and Physics. I am putting this together to keep track of the things I study.

## Modes under exploration

- The Neural Process family: [Conditional Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01613) (CNPs), [Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622) (NPs) and [Attentive Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05761) (ANPs).
- Approximate inference for Gaussian Processes.
- Stochastic processes and stochastic differential equations.
- Bayesian Methods for Adaptive Models: A reproduction of [David MacKay's PhD thesis](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/thesis.pdf).
