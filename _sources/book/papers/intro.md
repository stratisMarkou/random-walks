# Stream of papers

This is a place to collect notes and demos on papers that I read from the literature.
They are collectted here in stream-style, i.e. the papers I read most recently will be on top and the ones I read least recently at the bottom.
If you spot any errors or have other feedback, please feel free to [email me](mailto:stratismar@gmail.com).
