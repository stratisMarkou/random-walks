These are notes on the book *Measure, integration and real analysis* by Sheldon Axler, which is [freely available online](http://measure.axler.net/).
These notes are work in progress as we are currently reading through the book in a reading group with Adrian Goldwaser and Shreyas Padhy.
I have included solutions to some of the exercises which we have solved as we go along.
Any errors in these notes or solutions to the exercise are most likely my own.
