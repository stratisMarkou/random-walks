# Probability: An introduction

These are notes on the book, *Probability: An Introduction* {cite:p}`grimmettprob`.
They are meant to be a condensed format of the definitions and results in the book.
The book has a lot of great exercises and I found it very useful to go through them.
All mistakes contained in these notes are mine with probability $1$.
