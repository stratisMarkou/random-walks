    "[Transformers](../transformers/transformers.ipynb) are an extremely flexible deep architecture which has impacted a range of machine learning applications.\n",
    "Arguably, the impact of the transformer is due to a combination of its expressivity and its flexibility: it can easily be applied to different data modalities with minimal implementation changes.\n",
    "The feature that distinguishes the transformer over other architectures is its attention layer.\n",
    "Attention allows the transformer block to update the features of its input tokens in a way that depends on the features themselves, making the overall architecture highly expressive.\n",
    "Further, given pre-tokenised data, attention can be straightforwardly applied and many of the details of the data can be abstracted away, which means that the transformer can be easily applied to a range of modalities such as text, images, graphs and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one important limitation of atention is that its computation and memory costs scale quadratically with the number of tokens.\n",
    "This makes standard transformers difficult to scale to inputs with many tokens such as, for example, long sentences or large images.\n",
    "The shifted window transformer (Swin) {cite}`liu2021swin` is an architecture which helps mitigate the issues of computational and memory complexity.\n",
    "Swin was originally formulated to tackle image data, on which we focus here, but note that the main idea behind Swin is also applicable to other data modalities such as text or, more generally, any kind of gridded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The innovation of the Swin transformer is to apply attention in a local way, such that only tokens which are near each other (in some appropriate sense of closeness) are allowed to attend to one another.\n",
    "In this sense Swin transformers are somewhat similar to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where each input pixel affects only a local neighbourhood of output pixels at each layer of the network.\n",
    "This reduces the computational cost of the Swin transformer from quadratic to linear in the number of input tokens allowing scaling to large numbers of tokens."

    "## Windowed self-attention\n",
    "The main bottleneck in scaling transformers to large numbers of tokens is the self-attention operation.\n",
    "Given $N$ tokens, simply building an $N \\times N$ attention matrix requires $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ compute and memory, which gets very expensive very quickly for large images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{margin}\n",
    "Note that we are using the words _chunks_ and _windows_ to distinguish from the word _patches_.\n",
    "A window in a Swin transformer may contain several patches, each of which may contain several input tokens, e.g. pixels.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "The idea behind the Swin transformer is to modify the self-attention operation, by breaking up an input image into smaller chunks, or windows, and having each token attend to all other tokens within its window, and to no other tokens outside it, as illustrated in {numref}`swin:vit_vs_swin`."

    "Whereas in a standard vision transformer (left) each token (gray squares) attends to every other token in the image (large red square), in a Swin transformer each token attends only to those tokens within its window (smaller red squares), and none outside it.\n",
    "This significantly reduces the size of the attention matrices that need to be calculated.\n",
    "For example in the ViT in the illustration above, we have $64$ tokens, resulting in a $64 \\times 64$ attention matrix which has $4096$ entries.\n",
    "Breaking these up into four independent windows means each attention window contains $16$ tokens, resulting in four $16 \\times 16$ attention matrices with $256$ entries, for a total of $1024$ attention matrix entries across all four windows - a factor of $4$ lower.\n",
    "These savings become much more significant for larger images, and increase as the window size is reduced.\n",
    "However, this approach has a problem: tokens across different windows do not affect each other, which is a problem.\n",
    "Swin gets around this issue by shifting the windows."

    "Note that applying a transformer block with shifted attention windows is equivalent to shifting the image first and applying the transformer block on the original windows.\n",

    "In order to allow information to propagate across windows, Swin uses window shifting.\n",
    "Specifically, each windowed transformer block is followed by a window shifting operation.\n",

    "This is illustrated by {numref}`swin:shifting`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The only remaining question is how to handle windows that are cut short at the image boundaries when applying a shifting operation.\n",

    "The colours correspond to groups of tokens which attend to one another within the shifted block.\n",
    "Faint colours denote pixel values before and after the application of the transformer block itself.\n",
    "Given an input image (first) we apply a shift of two pixels (half the window size of four pixels) downwards and rightwards, which groups together tokens along the boundaries of the image (second).\n",
    "We then apply the transformer block to the shifted image (third) followed by the reverse shifting operation, which brings back the tokens in their original positions (right).\n",
    "This procedure, i.e. shifting the image and applying a transformer block with regular attention windows, is equivalent to applying a transformer block with shifted attention windows.\n",

    "One might wonder what the inverse of a patch extraction operation is, or rather how to implement it efficiently.\n",
    "It turns out that patch extraction operations can't always be inverted, i.e. not for all choices of striding, window sizes and dilation, but for those settings for which an inverse exists, the inverse can be expressed and implemented in a very neat way.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Invertibility.__\n",
    "Under certain conditions patch extraction can be inverted, leveraging the fact that the reverse operation is actually its transpose.\n",
    "However, there are exaples of patch extraction which are not invertible.\n",
    "For example, if we use large strides and small patch sizes, or if we use dilation (also known as à trous; this is the `rate` argument in `tf.image.extract_patches`), then some of the pixels of the input image may be skipped over, making patch extraction non-invertible.\n",
    "From now on, we will assume that the patch extraction is performed using a combination of patch size, striding and dilation such that every pixel in the input affects the output, and no pixels are skipped over.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Matrix view.__\n",
    "Suppose the input image $x$ is an array of shape $(H, W, C),$ where $H$ is its height, $W$ is its width and $C$ is the number of channels.\n",
    "We can view patch extraction as a linear operation $P$ which maps the image $x$ to another image $y = P(x),$ of shape $(I, J, K),$ where the dimensions denote the horizontal patch index, vertical patch index and patch dimension respectively.\n",
    "Note that by the definition of patch extraction, each pixel in the output is affected by exactly one pixel in the input (though each pixel in the input may affect more than one pixel in the output).\n",
    "For now, let us assume that each pixel in the input affects exactly one pixel in the output, i.e. each $x_{hwc}$ affects exactly one $y_{ijk}.$\n",
    "Let's define $\\texttt{flat}$ to be the operation that takes a multi-dimensional array and flattens it into a single-dimensional array.\n",
    "Since $\\texttt{flat}$ is an invertible linear operation, and patch extraction is also an invertible linear operation, then their composition is also an invertible linear opeartion $P'.$\n",

    "The equation $\\texttt{flat}(y) = \\mathcal{M}(P') \\texttt{flat}(x)$ still holds, and the matrix $\\mathcal{M}(P')$ stil contains a single $1$ per row.\n",
    "However, $\\mathcal{M}(P')$ may now contain multiple $1$ entries in each column.\n",
    "Therefore, it is no longer a permutation matrix, and $\\texttt{flat}(x) \\neq \\mathcal{M}(P')^\\top \\texttt{flat}(y).$\n",
    "In particular, when we multiply $\\texttt{flat}(y)$ by $\\mathcal{M}(P')^\\top,$ each entry of $\\texttt{flat}(x)$ which affects $n$ entries in $\\texttt{flat}(y)$ will be counted $n$ times.\n",

    "To allow for information to propagate across windows, Swin applies window shifting between consecutive transformer blocks.\n",
