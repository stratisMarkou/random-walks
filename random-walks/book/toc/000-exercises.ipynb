    "By the pigeonhole principle, since there are more than $k$ strings and only $k$ states, two strings, say $s_1 \\in S$ and $s_1 \\in S$ must end up in the same final state.\n",
    "Then, for any string $z$, including the empty string, the strings $s_1 z$ and $s_2 z$ will end up in the same final states, so they are either both accepted or both rejected by $M$, which means they are indistinguishable.\n",
    "This is a contradiction, so $L$ cannot have an index greater than $k$.\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose that $L$ has a finite index $k$.\n",
    "Then, there exists a finite set of strings of size $k$, say $S = \\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$, which is pairwise distinguishable by $L$.\n",
    "We know, from {ref}`Exercise 1.51 <toc-ex-151>`, that indistinguishability under $L$ is an equivalence relation $\\equiv_L$.\n",
    "Now note that any string $z$ is indistiguishable from at least one string in $S$ (because if not, then the index of $L$ would be larger than $k$) and at most one string in $S$ (beacuse if $z \\equiv_L s_i, s_j \\in S$, then $s_i \\equiv_L s_j$), so any string $z$ is indistinguishable from exactly one string in $L$.\n",

    "We need to show that this $M$ is well defined, that is we need to show that $\\delta(q, a) = \\pi(xa)$ gives the same answer regardless of which representative $x$ of $q$ we pick.\n",
    "To show this, let $x, y$ be strings such that $\\pi(x) = \\pi(y) = q$.\n",
    "Then $x$ and $y$ are in the same equivalence class so they are indistinguishable, so $xa$ and $ya$ are also indistinguishable, so $\\pi(xa) = \\pi(ya)$ as required and $\\delta$ is well defined.\n",

    "Therefore $L$ is regular if and only if it has a finite index.\n",
    "In addition, the index of $L$ is the size of the smallest DFA recognising it: part 2 implies that if the index of $L$ is $k$, then it is recognised by a DFA with $k$ states and part 1 implies that $L$ cannot be recognised by a DFA with fewer than $k$ states.\n",
