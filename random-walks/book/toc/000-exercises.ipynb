    "A _synchronising sequence_ for $M$ and $h$ is a string $s \\in \\Sigma^*$  where $\\delta(q, s) = h$ for every $q \\in Q$. (Here we have extended $\\delta$ to strings, so that $\\delta(q, s)$ equals the state wherre $M$ ends up when $M$ starts at state $q$ and reads input $s$.) Say that $M$ is _synchronisable_ if it has a synchronising sequence for some state $h$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $M = (Q, \\Sigma, \\delta, q_0, F)$ be a $k$-state synchronisable DFA.\n",
    "Since it is synchronisable, there exists a synchronising sequence $s = s_1\\dots s_N$ where $s_N \\in \\Sigma$, with synchronising state $h$.\n",
    "Let $q_i \\neq q_j \\in Q$ be two distinct states.\n",
    "Since $h$ is a synchronising sequence, then $\\{\\delta(q_i, s), \\delta(q_j, s)\\} = \\{h\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the sequence of sets $P_n = \\{\\delta(q_i, s_1\\dots s_n), \\delta(q_j, s_1\\dots s_n)\\}$ for $n = 0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n",
    "If $P_n = P_{n+k}$ for any $0 \\leq n \\leq N - 1$ and any $k > 1$, we can obtain a shortened version of $s$, say $s'$,  with length $|s'| = N - k$, which still satisfies $\\delta(q_i, s') = \\delta(q_j, s') = h$, by removing the substring $s_{n+1} \\dots s_{n+k}$ from $s$ to obtain $s' = s_1 \\dots s_{n} s_{n+k+1} \\dots s_N$.\n",
    "We can repeat this procedure to obtain a string $s'$ which, when fed into $M$, produces a sequence of pairs of states such that no pair is repeated and the final pair is equal to $\\{h\\}$.\n",
    "Because no pair is repeated, the maximum length of $s$ is $k(k+1)/2$ by the pigeonhole principle.\n",
    "Therefore for each pair of unique states $q_i \\neq q_j \\in Q$, there exists a sequence $s_{ij}$ which maps them both to $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider placing a distinct marker on each state, which moves according to the transition function when an input is fed into $M$.\n",
    "Once two markers enter the same state, they cannot separate and stay joined.\n",
    "By the result above, we can join any two markers with at most $k(k+1)/2$ symbols, regardless of the state from which state they are in, so we can join all of them with at most $k^2(k+1)/2$ symbols (by joining the first and the second marker, then joining the third marker to the already joined first and second markers, and so on).\n",
    "This shows the required result, and slightly improves on it.\n",
