<p>These are notes and implementations I made off the course <a href="https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A">Convex Optimization I</a>, taught by <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/">Stephen Boyd</a> from Stanford. You can find the full course materials at the <a href="https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A">official course page</a>. Video lectures can also be found at <a href="http://videolectures.net/stanfordee364aw08_convex_optimization1/">videolectures.net</a>. The course follows the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">Convex Optimisation book</a> by Boyd and Vanderberghe, freely available on the web.</p>
<p>A lot of the contents of these notes are a combination of the contents of the lectures and book, except I've filled in some gaps I would have liked to have been explained to me when I read the course.</p>
