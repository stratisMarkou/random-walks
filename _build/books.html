Language as an instinct<a class="anchor-link" href="#1.-Language-as-an-instinct"> </a></h3><p><strong>Shorter:</strong> Introduces commonly held views which he promises he will refute in the book, and gives the main thesis: language is an instinct, not a taught response.</p>
<p><strong>Longer:</strong> Commonly held views that Pinker promises to refute in the book</p>
<ul>
<li>Our command of language is a distinguishing feature which irrevocably separates humans from animals.</li>
<li>It is so highly integrated with our experience that without it, thought itself is virtually unimaginable.</li>
<li>Differences between languages cause their speakers to construe reality in
different ways.</li>
<li>Speech is learnt from role models and caregivers and grammar/syntax through
schools, therefore language is a cultural artifact that is aqcuired by
children as they grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Chomsky's findings provide ground for refutations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typical sentences constructed by a person are virtually unique. They have not
been repeated before, so a language cannot be "a repertoire of responses". The brain must contain rules for constructing such an
infinitude of sentences from a finite set of words. <strong>Personal opinion:</strong> Compelling evidence for arguing that language is not a taught response, like
teaching an animal to respond to a command, but language
could still be a set of <em>taught</em> rules that are aqcuired during upbringing.
These could still be sufficient to make up the immense range of possible
sentences that we observe.</li>
<li>Children unlock the ability to create unique, unrepeated sentences very early on, with very sparse and limited input from their environment. Chomsky argues this is evidence that humans are equiped from birth with <strong>Universal Grammar</strong>, a plan that is common to all languages and enables children to quickly aqcuire new languages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Chapter-2">Chapter 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Chapter-2"> </a></h3><p><strong>Shorter:</strong> Humans can both invent and spontaneously refine language, as well
as quickly learn to generalise grammatical rules from very sparse inputs. This
is evidence that language is an instinct not a response.</p>
<p><strong>Longer:</strong> People in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea">New Guinea</a> had lived in isolation from the outside for 40,000 years until 1930. They had language - several huundred different languages among all the isolated people. This suggests that language is universal, there is no evidence of a "cradle of language" in a particular region. <strong>Personal opinion:</strong> Although one could point out that language could have been developed in one single seed-event in history, from which all other tribes acquired it, I find this point fairly convincing.</p>
<p>We can find grammar and sophistication in languages commonly thought of as
ungrammatical, <strong>sophistication is universal</strong>. Black English Vernacular (BEV) is an example of a dialect commonly held as ungrammatical: <em>You ain't goin' to no heaven</em> vs <em>You aren't going to heaven</em> is not a grammatical mistake but a feature of BEV, like the <em>ne ... pas</em> formation. Therefore grammatical/ungrammatical sentences must be defined with respect to the grammatical rules of the speaker's language and dialect. Sophistication and structure can be found more commonly than one would expect.</p>
<p>People can and have <em>created languages in extremely short time-spans</em> as a
result of a need to communicate - these languages are called <strong>pidgin languages</strong>. Haiwaiian pidgin was invented by a mix of workers from "China, Japan, Korea, Portugal, the Phillipines and Puerto Rico". <strong>Pidgin</strong> is refined with generations into a <strong>consistent and systematic</strong> language called a creole - not a crude version of the seed languages. Notable example of Simon, a deaf-born boy who aqcuired sign language poorly from his parents, who aqcuired it late and were not proficient - he refined their usage and did not repeat the mistakes they made, evidence that children have an innate linguistic ability. People have the ability to learn, invent and refine languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Children generalising grammar ('ed'/'is'/'s')</li>
<li>Independence of thought from rest of congition</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Chapter-3">Chapter 3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Chapter-3"> </a></h3><p><strong>Shorter:</strong> Thought is not built upon language, but more likely the other way
around. Thought without language is not only conveivable but occurs often.</p>
<p><strong>Longer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conventional absurdities (Hopi time, Eskimo hoax)</li>
<li>Ildefonso</li>
<li>Language != mentalese: rotations mental pictures</li>
<li>Turing computer, tusk/Africa, deixis</li>
<li>grammatical+senseless/ungrammatical+insensible.</li>
</ul>
