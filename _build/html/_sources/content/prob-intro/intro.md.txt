# Probability: An introdction

These are notes on the book, *Probability: An Introduction* by Grimmett and
 Walsh. {cite}`grimmettprob` They are meant to be a condensed format of the
  definitions and results in the book, mostly without proofs. The book has a
   lot of great exercises and I found it very useful to go through them.
