# Convex optimisation

These are notes and implementations I made off the course [Convex Optimization I](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A), taught by [Stephen Boyd](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/) from Stanford. You can find the full course materials at the [official course page](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A). Video lectures can also be found at [videolectures.net](http://videolectures.net/stanfordee364aw08_convex_optimization1/). The course follows the [Convex Optimisation book](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) by Boyd and Vanderberghe, freely available on the web.

A lot of the contents of these notes are a combination of the contents of the lectures and book, except I've filled in some gaps I would have liked to have been explained to me when I read the course.
