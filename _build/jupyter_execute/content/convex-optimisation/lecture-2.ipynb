    "**Convex hull:** of a set $S$, $\\textbf{conv}S$, is the set of all convex combinations of $S$. It is the smallest convex set that contains $S$, as any convex superset of $S$ must contain all convex combinations of elements in $S$ and by extension $\\textbf{conv}S$ as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Convex cone:** a set which contains all conic combinations of its points. Since the set of conic combinations of a set subsumes the set of convex combinations, such a set is convex as well as a cone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conic hull:** of a set $C$ is the smallest set which contains all conic combinations of $C$. A conic hull is the smallest convex cone that contains $C$, by the same argument applied to convex hulls and convex sets.\n",

    "$$Ax \\preccurlyeq b, \\text{ and } Cx = d,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\preccurlyeq$ is the component-wise inequality. Polyhedra are convex and can be expressed as an intersection of finitely many halfspaces (inequalities) and hyperplances (equalities).\n",

    "## Positive-semidefinite cone\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all positive-semidefinite matrices $\\mathbf{S}_+^n = \\{X~|~ z^\\top Xz \\geq 0~\\forall~z \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\}$ is a convex cone:\n",
    "\n",

    "X, Y \\in \\mathbf{S}_{++}^n \\implies \\theta_1 X + \\theta_2 Y \\in \\mathbf{S}_{++}^n, \\text{ if } \\theta_1, \\theta_2 > 0.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these sets is that $\\mathbf{S}_+^n$ is closed, whereas $\\mathbf{S}_{++}^n$ is open. Both of these are examples of convex sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations that preserve convexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intersection:** The intersection of any number of convex sets is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show this, suppose $S_1, S_2, ...$ is a (finite or infinite) sequence of convex sets whose intersection is $S$ and $x, y \\in S$, then $x, y$ are inside every $S_n$ and so is the line segment between them (by convexity of $S_n$). This implies the line segment is itself in $S$, showing $S$ is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Affine function:** An affine mapping, $f(x) = Ax + b$, of a convex set is also convex. Convexity is also preserved under inverses of affine maps, where the inverse map is defined as $f^{-1}(S)\\{x~|~f(x) \\in S\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the first statement, let $S_1$ be a convex set, $S_2 = f(S_1)$ and $x, y \\in S_1$. Then the line segment $\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y, \\theta \\in [0, 1]$ is in $S_1$ and\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f\\big(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y\\big) = \\theta Ax + (1 - \\theta) Ay + b = \\theta f(x) + (1 - \\theta) f(y)~\\in~f(S_2) \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "so $S_2$ is convex. To show the second statement, let $S_2$ be a convex set, $S_1 = f^{-1}(S_2)$ and $x, y \\in S_2$. Then $f^{-1}(x), f^{-1}(y) \\subset S_1$, and we want to show that if $x^* \\in f^{-1}(x), y^* \\in f^{-1}(y)$, then the line segment $\\theta x^* + (1 - \\theta)y^*$ is also in $S_1$. By the convexity of $S_2$, the line segment $\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y$ is in $S_2$, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f\\Big(\\big\\{\\theta x^* + (1 - \\theta)y^* | x^* \\in f^{-1}(x), y^* \\in f^{-1}(y)\\big\\}\\Big) = \\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y \\in S_2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "and since the left hand side is in $S_2$, the argument of $f$ on the left hand side must be a subset of $S_1$ (by the definition of $f^{-1}$), showing that $S_1$ is convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perspective function:** A perspective function $f : \\{x~|~ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\text{ and } x_n > 0\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n - 1}$ is the mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_{n}}, \\frac{x_2}{x_{n}}, ..., \\frac{x_{n-1}}{x_{n}} \\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and it is a convex function. The perspective function can be interpreted as a projection of a point in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to the image plane of a pinhole camera. It is also closely related to homogeneous coordinates, used in graphics and computer vision - for further reading see Roberto Cipolla's [notes on Computer Vision](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~cipolla/lectures/4F12/Slides/2019-4F12-notes-3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear-fractional function:** A perspective function $f : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ is a mapping of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\left(\\frac{x_1}{x_{n}}, \\frac{x_2}{x_{n}}, ..., \\frac{x_{n-1}}{x_{n}} \\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and is also a convex function. It is a generalisation of the perspective funtion, and equal to it if $c^\\top = [0, 0, ..., 1]$ and $d = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proper cones, generalised inequalities, minimum and minimal elements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proper cone:** A convex cone is a proper cone if it is\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Closed (contains its boundary),\n",
    "2. Solid (it has non-zero interior) and\n",
    "3. Pointed (does not contain a line).\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper cones are used to define another useful concept, the generalised inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalised inequality:** The generalised inequalities $\\preccurlyeq_K$ and $\\prec_K$ with respect to a proper cone $K$ are defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x \\preccurlyeq_K y &\\implies y - x \\in K \\\\\n",
    "x \\prec_K y &\\implies y - x \\in \\textbf{ int}(K).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In general however, we might have both $x \\not \\preccurlyeq_K y$ and $x \\not \\succcurlyeq_K y$ simultaneously, if $x$ and $y$ are not comparable under the inequality. For example, comparing the points $x = (1, 0)$ and $y = (-1, 1)$ using the inequality $\\preccurlyeq_{\\mathbb{R}^2_{+}}$ (where $\\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$ is the positive quadrant of $\\mathbb{R}^2$), we see that neither $x \\preccurlyeq_{\\mathbb{R}^2_{+}} y$ nor $x \\succcurlyeq_{\\mathbb{R}^2_{+}} y$ hold, because neither $y - x$ nor $x - y$ are in $\\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$. This inequality is therefore a *partial ordering*, and we need to distinguish between different kinds of \"minimum\" points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum element:** The minimum element $x$ of $S$ satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y \\in S \\implies x \\preccurlyeq_K y.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So *if $y \\in S$ then $y$ is no greater than $x$*. Thus $x$ can be compared to all other points $y \\in S$ and inequality can be unambiguously decided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal element:** A minimal element $x$ of $S$ satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y \\in S, y \\preccurlyeq_K x \\implies x = y.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if there is another element $y$ in $S$ such that it can be compared to $x$ and is in fact smaller than or equal to $x$, then $x = y$. The reason we define minimal elements in addition to minimum elements, is to deal with cases where not all points can be compared to each other, like the $\\mathbb{R}^2_{+}$ example above. In such cases, there may not be a minimum point but there will be minimal points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Separating hyperplane theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "If $C$ and $D$ are disjoint convex sets, then there exist $a \\neq 0$ and $b$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&a^\\top x \\leq b \\text{ for } x \\in C \\\\\n",
    "\\text{ and } &a^\\top x \\geq b \\text{ for } x \\in D.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the plane separates the two sets. Strict inequality would require further restrictions: consider the case where $C$ is an open (does not contain its boundary) convex set and $D$ is a point on the boundary of $C$; strict equality $a^\\top x > b \\text{ for } x \\in D$ would not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supporting hyperplane theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supporting hyperplane:** A supporting hyperplane to $C$, at an $x_0$ on the boundary of $C$, is the set: $$\\{x | a^\\top x = a^\\top x_0\\},$$ where $a \\neq 0$ and $a^\\top x \\leq a^\\top x_0$ for $x \\in C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supporting hyperplane theorem:** If $C$ is a convex set, then there exists a supporting hyperplane to $C$ at every one of its boundary points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supporting hyperplane theorem can be proved by using the separating hyperplane theorem. If $x_0$ is a boundary point of $C$ we can define $D = \\{x_0\\}$, and apply the separating hyperplane theorem to show that a separating hyperplane exists, which is also supporting because $x_0$ is on the boundary of $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual cones and dual generalised inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual cone:** the dual cone of a cone $K$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K^* = \\{z~|~ z^\\top x \\geq 0 \\text{ for all } x \\in K\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and satisfies the useful properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $K^*$ is closed and convex.\n",
    "- If $K_1 \\subseteq K_2$ then $K_2^* \\subseteq K_1^*$.\n",
    "- If $K$ has nonempty interior, then $K^*$ is pointed.\n",
    "- If the closure of $K$ is pointed then $K^*$ has non-empty interior.\n",
    "- $K^{**}$ is the closure of the convex hull of $K$. If $K$ is closed and convex to begin with, then $K = K^{**}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual generalised inequalities:** The dual cones of proper cones are proper, and can also be used to define generalised inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x \\preccurlyeq_{K^*} y &\\implies y - x \\in K^* \\\\\n",
    "x \\prec_{K^*} y &\\implies y - x \\in \\textbf{ int}(K^*).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important properties that relate generalised inequalities and their duals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x \\preccurlyeq_K y \\iff \\lambda^\\top x \\leq \\lambda^\\top y$ for all $\\lambda \\succcurlyeq_{K*} 0$,\n",
    "- $x \\prec_K y \\iff \\lambda^\\top x < \\lambda^\\top y$ for all $\\lambda \\succcurlyeq_{K*} 0, \\lambda \\neq 0$,\n",
    "\n",
    "and since $K = K^{**}$ for proper cones, the above properties also hold if $K^*$ and $K^{**}$ are swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum and minimal elements via dual inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the following conditions on minimum and minimal elements based on dual inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum element:** An element $x \\in S$ is the minimum element of $S$ if and only if $x$ is the unique minimiser of $\\lambda^\\top z, z \\in S$ for all $\\lambda \\succ_{K^*} 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal element:** An element $x \\in S$ is a minimal element of $S$ if $x$ minimises $\\lambda^\\top z, z \\in S$ for some $\\lambda \\succcurlyeq_{K^*} 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The converse of the above statement is generally not true. If $x$ is a minimal point, it is not true in general that there exists $\\lambda \\succ_{K^*} 0$, such that $x$ minimises $\\lambda^\\top z, z \\in S$. However, if $S$ is convex, then a necessary and sufficient condition exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal element of a convex set:** An element $x$ of a convex set $S$, is minimal if and only if there exists $\\lambda \\succcurlyeq_{K^*} 0$ such that $x$ minimises $\\lambda^\\top z, z \\in S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the statements on minimal elements, the strict inequality $\\lambda \\succ_{K^*} 0$ plays an important role. If $\\lambda \\succcurlyeq_{K^*} 0$ was used in the statements, counter-examples can be easily found."
