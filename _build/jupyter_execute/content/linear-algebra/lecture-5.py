# Positive-definite and Semidefinite Matrices

## Positive-definite matrices

Five tantamount criteria:

1. Strictly positive eigenvalues $\lambda > 0$.
2. Positive quadratic from $x^\top S x > 0$.
3. All leading determinants are positive.
4. All pivots are positive.
5. Can be written as $S = A^\top A$, where the columns of $A$ are independent.

## Positive semi-definite matrices

1. Non-negative eigenvalues $\lambda \geq 0$.
2. Non-negative quadratic from $x^\top S x > 0$.
3. Can be written as $S = A^\top A$.
