# Wind turbine energy balance

Several times I have heard the claim that wind turbines have a negative
 energy balance, meaning that the energy put into manufacturing them, to mine
   and process ore, manufacture the various parts, transport and installation
   , take more energy than what the turbine outputs in its lifetime. I was
    curious if this claim is true so I made an estimate.

## A rough upper bound

A N1000 1MW Nordic Windpower turbine costs about 1-2 million, let’s say 1.5
 million. If instead of building the turbine we used the same money to buy
  gasoline, and burned that gasoline in a utility-scale power plant to
   harvest electric energy, here’s how much energy we would get. One litre of
    gasoline produces 34.2 MJ/L of energy per litre, of which approximately
     40% gets converted into electrical energy, giving 15 MJ/L in electric
      energy. Now at 1.5 euros/L, that would be 10 MJ/euro if we bought
       gasoline and burnt it at a utility-scale power plant (without
        including the cost of the plant). How much would the turbine have to
         work for to make up for the energy taken to produce it? We’ve just
          seen that 10 MJ/euro is an upper bound to what the energy content
           of a turbine (because the 1.5 million / MW price tag of the
            turbine includes all the energy put into manufacturing it, as
             well as raw materials wages etc), so the energy content of a
              wind turbine is at most (10 MJ/euro) x (1.5 million euros) = 1
              .5 x 10^7 MJ per turbine. At maximum output and without
               considering  any maintenance costs yet, the turbine will take
                1.5 x 10^7 seconds = 173 days = 0.5 years, to cover this
                 energy debt.

## More realistic bound

Now, wind turbines do not work all the time, neither do they work at maximum
 capacity. If a wind turbine works 25% of the time, at 50% of its capacity on
  average, then it would take 4 years to cover its energy debt. We should
   however acknowledge that the upper bound we placed above is probably too
    large, because not all of the cost of producing a wind turbine is used
     for energy (mining ore, processing it, manufacturing the parts and
      installation), so it probably takes less than 1.5 x 10^7 MJ to produce
       a turbine. We therefore expect that it wouldn’t take much longer than
        a few years for a wind turbine to cover its energy debt, and since
         turbines last for 1-2 decades, we can probably assume they would
          repay this debt.

We could object that we should also include the maintenance/inspection costs
 of the turbine, but here we are interested purely in the energy footprint of
  the turbine, and whether it will output more energy than what is used to
   produce it, during its lifetime.

## Takeaway

The claim that, throughout its lifetime, a wind turbine does not produce more
 energy than what is used to produce it, is probably not true. If a turbine
  was placed in an especially poor location, so that its output is orders of
   magnitude below what we assumed above, perhaps the picture could be
    different. At least under these estimates, wind turbines do repay their
     energy debt.

Last, this estimate account for the financial or environmental viability of
 wind turbines, their impact on fauna and flora, or whether they degrade the
  natural beauty of sites at which they are installed. All of these are very
   important issues, each worth lots of discussion on its own.
