    "\n",
    "The Variational Free Energy (VFE) method {cite}`titsias2009variational` applied to GPs, is an approach for approximating the posterior $p(f | \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X})$ of a Gaussian Process. Instead of computing the exact GP posterior, VFE approximates it by another Gaussian distribution, which is cheaper to manipulate when making predictions or evaluating the marginal likelihood $p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{X})$. Similarly to other GP approximations, VFE achieves lower a computational cost by making sparsity assumptions. However, whereas other sparse methods like FITC and DTC make sparsity assumptions on the *likelihood*, VFE makes these assumptions on the *approximate posterior* and this has several important effects. $ \\def\\Kxx{\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{X}}}\n",

    "## The Variational Free Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the log marginal likelihood of the data can be costly or intractable to compute. To circumvent this difficulty, one solution is to optimise an alternative objective instead of the log-marginal. This objective should be chosen such that (1) it is cheap to evaluate; (2) optimising it cannot lead to worse overfitting than the original model. The Variational Free Energy (VFE), also known as the ELBO, can be used to meet both these criteria. The precise same bound is used for a variety of other models involving latent variables - including Gassian Mixture Models, Variational Autoencoders or Bayesian Networks to mention a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VFE meets the two criteria above because (1) it can be cheap to evaluate if we make sensible approximation choices; (2) it lower bounds the marginal likelihood, so we can optimise it with respect to the hyperparameters without fear of overfitting any worse than the exact model would. The latter point is especially important because it decouples modelling assumptions (the awesome model we'd like to have) from our approximations (which we make out of computational necessity). A user can therefore state their assumptions clearly upfornt and buy themselves as good an approximation to the exact model as their comptational budget can afford them. We'll expand on this further, later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a short derivation for the VFE, which can be used as a starting point for *any* latent variable model. Suppose we want to evalate the marginal likelihood of some data $\\mathbf{y}$ given some other data $\\mathbf{x}$ under a model with latent variables $\\mathbf{s}$ and parameters $\\bs{\\theta}$\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For Gaussian mixture models, $\\mathbf{s}$ are cluster memberships of the datapoints, often written $\\mathbf{c}$. For VAEs, $\\mathbf{s}$ is the latent representation, often written $\\mathbf{z}$. For GPs it will denote a set of latent function values $\\mathbf{f}$. Now, defining a new probability distribution over $\\mathbf{s}$, written $q(\\mathbf{s})$. This is widely referred to as the *variational posterior*. If we subtract the KL divergence between $q(\\mathbf{s})$ and the true posterior $p(\\mathbf{s} | \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{x})$ from the marginal likelihood, we get the inequality\n",

    "\n",
    "where we have used the fact that the KL is non-negative. This shows that the VFE, $\\mathcal{F}$, is a lower bound to the exact marginal likelihood. We made no assumptions about the distribution $q$ and the inequality always holds, irrespective of our choice of $q$. The inequality becomes an equality when $q$ is equal to the true posterior, where the KL divergence becomes zero, attaining its minimum value. Although we could pick $q$ to be any distribution we like, we should seek a $q$ which makes $\\mathcal{F}$ as large as possible while still remaining computationally tractable. It turns out that the VFE approximation for GPs achieves an excellent tradeoff between approximating the true posterior and keeping the computational cost low."

    "## Sparse VFE approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the idea of introducing inducing points, much like those of the  DTC{cite}`seeger2003fast` or FITC{cite}`snelson2005sparse` approximations, we will see how the VFE approximation will result in an approximate form which is significantly cheaper to work with than the exact GP. Unlike the DTC or FITC however, VFE approximates the posterior over the latent function $f$ rather than the model. Whereas models like DTC or FITC can overfit when optimising their inducing points and model parameters $\\theta$, the VFE approximation does not run this risk at all because it uses the Free Energy to optimise inducing points and parameters. Since the Free Energy is a lower bound to the exact log-marginal likelihood, VFE is guaranteed not to overfit any more than the exact GP would.\n",

Such matrices can be inverted in $\\mathcal{O}\\lrb[\\min(M, N)^3]$ time, using the [Woodbury Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity). The second term involves the trace of a matrix which, when $M < N$, requires $\\mathcal{O}\\lrb[NM^2]$ to compute. Therefore, the overal complexity of computing $\\mathcal{F}$ is $\\mathcal{O}\\lrb[NM^2]$, which is a significant gain over $\\mathcal{O}\\lrb[N^3]$ if $M << N$."

    "### Cost and quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to review the VFE approximation. How did we achieve the improvement from $\\mathcal{O}\\lrb[N^3]$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\lrb[NM^2]$? In the original GP posterior predictive, we considered statistical relationships between all datapoints $\\X, \\bm{y}$ and the prediction points $\\X^*, \\bm{y}^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "By approximating $p\\lrb[f | \\bm{y}, \\X]$ with the distribution $p\\lrb[f_{\\neq \\Xb} | \\fb] q\\lrb[\\fb]$, we instead account for statistical relationships only between $\\fb$ and $f$, thereby reducing the cost of evaluating the posterior predictive. The information of how $\\mathbf{y}$ affects $\\mathbf{y}^*$ is entirely contained in the distribution $q\\lrb[\\fb]$, the form of which is picked to approximate the the true posterior as accurately as possible. Although this summarised representation reduces the cost of making predictions, it also limits the set of posterior distributions which can be accurately represented by our model. A way in which this approximation might fail is if there are not enough inducing points to sufficiently constrain the approximate posterior - consider the extreme case of using a single (or zero) inducing points to model many data points. This could be either due to picking too small an $M$, or placing the inducing points' inputs $\\Xb$ at poor locations, leaving large areas of the input space uncovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the dataset size $N$ increases, a greater number of inducing points may be needed. In particular, if we wish to approximate the exact posterior $p\\lrb[\\fx | \\fb]$ sufficiently accurately throughout a larger input region, we may need more inducing points and thus a larger $M$. The scaling of $M$ will therefore depend on (1) the distribution of input data $\\bm{X}$, (2) the type of kernel used and (3) the specified quality of approxmation, for example in KL distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the positions $\\Xb$ of the inducing points are important and we haven't talked about how to optimise those. One of the main contributions of the VFE approximation is to provide a principled way of selecting the inducing point locations, which is to optimise $\\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\\Xb$. This can be done without fear of overfitting, because we are optimising $\\mathcal{F}$ which is a lower bound to the exact log-marginal likelihood. Adding more inducing points or optimising their locations for longer will only bring the approximate posterior closer to the true posterior. This is not so for model-approximating methods like DTC{cite}`seeger2003fast` or FITC{cite}`snelson2005sparse` which approximate the model rather than the posterior. In this case, there is no guarantee that adding more inducing points or optimising their locations won't overfit. This is one of the strengths of the VFE approximation."

    "### Implementing the VFE GP\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now put things together and implement the `VFEGP`. The `post_pred` and `free_energy` methods usee the Woodbury identity to speed up the inversion of the matrices required in this computation. It turns out however that when using the Woodbury identity, some of the matrices involved are poorly condtitioned. To alleviate this issue, I've found it necessary to make use of a [conditioning trick](https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/master/notebooks/theory/SGPR_notes.html?highlight=variational) also used in the GPFlow library."

    "Initially the positions of the inducing points (green) do not allow for an expressive enough posterior to match the exact GP posterior. By spreading out the inducing points, the model manages to recover an approximate posterior that is very close to the ground truth. We were expecting this to be possible since there are lots of observed data which are redundant, and should be summarisable by a smaller set of inducing points."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how the free energy may be used together with an inducing point approximate posterior to reduce the computational cost of doing infernce and learning with GPs. Unlike other methods such as DTC and FITC, the VFE method approximates the posterior rather than the model, bringing several benefits. VFE decouples model assumptions and approximations. In this way, it keeps the exact model sacrosanct and attempts to approximate it as faithfully as possible. Second, because the Free Energy is a lower bound to the marginal log-likelihood, it is impossible for VFE to overfit any more than the exact. model. By contrast, other methods can overfit more than the original GP.  VFE explicitly represents posterior uncertainty, keeping it separate from noise uncertainty whereas methods do not."
