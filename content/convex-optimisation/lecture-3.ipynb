    "**Convex function:** A function whose domain is convex, and which also satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f\\big(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y\\big) \\leq \\theta f(x) + (1 - \\theta) f(y),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for every $x, y \\in \\textbf{dom}(f)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strictly convex function:** As above, except the inequality is strict\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f\\big(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta) y\\big) < \\theta f(x) + (1 - \\theta) f(y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concave and strictly concave funtions:** Same as the definitions above except the inequality sign goes the other way - the domain still needs to be a convex set. The negative of a concave function is convex and vice versa.\n",

    "- affine: $ax + b$, for any $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "- exponential: $e^{\\alpha x}$ for any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "- powers: $x^\\alpha$ on $\\mathbb{R}_{++}$ for $\\alpha \\geq 1$ or $\\alpha \\leq 0$.\n",
    "- powers of absolute value: $|x|^p$ for $p \\geq 1$.\n",

    "- $p$-norm: $||x||_p = \\left[ \\sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i|^p\\right]^{1/p}$ for $p \\geq 0$.\n",

    "- spectral norm: $f(X) = ||X||_2 = \\sigma_{\\text{max}}(X) = \\lambda^{1/2}_{\\text{max}}(X^\\top X)$, where $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(\\cdot)$ is the maximum eigenvalue of a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restriction to a line\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restriction to a line:** A function $f$ from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is convex if and only if the restriction $g$ of $f$ on any line, is also convex\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(t) = f(x + tv),~~~\\textbf{dom}~g = \\{t~|~x + tv \\in \\textbf{dom}~f\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for any $x \\in \\textbf{dom}~f, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use of restriction:** Using the above result we can prove the convexity of quite complicated functions. Take for example the function $\\log \\det : \\mathbf{S}_{++}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and restrict it to a line along matrix $V$. For $\\textbf{dom}~g = \\{t~|~X + tV \\in \\textbf{dom}~f\\}$ to be non-empty, $V$ will have to be symmetric but does not have to be positive-definite. The restricted function $g$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "g(t) = \\log \\det (X + tV) &= \\log \\det X + \\log \\det (I + tX^{-1/2}VX^{-1/2})\\\\\n",
    "&= \\log \\det X + \\sum_{i = 1}^n  \\log (1 + t \\lambda_i)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda_i$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ eigenvalue of $X^{-1/2}VX^{-1/2}$ and $X^{-1/2}$ exists because $X$ is positive-definite. The components $\\log (1 + t \\lambda_i)$ are all concave regardless of the value of $\\lambda_i$, so $g$ is concave along any line in $\\mathbf{S}_{++}^n$ and thus $\\log \\det$ is also concave.\n",

    "## Extended value extension\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extended-value extension:** The extended-value extension $\\tilde{f}$ of $f$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{f}(x) = f(x) \\text{ if } x\\in \\textbf{dom}~f, \\text{ otherwise } \\infty.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition helps to extend the domain of convex functions to a larger set, for example extending $f(x) = x^2, \\textbf{dom}~f = \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ from the positive reals $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ to the whole real line $\\mathbb{R}$ and still have $\\tilde{f}$ be covex.\n",

    "\n",
    "**First-order differentiability (informal):** A function $f$ is differentiable if its domain is open and the gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla f(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, ..., \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "exists at each $x \\in \\textbf{dom}~f$. From this follows a first-order condition for covexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First-order condition:** A differentiable function $f$ with a convex domain is convex if and only if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) \\geq f(x_0) + \\nabla f(x_0)^\\top (x - x_0), \\text{ for all } x_0, x \\in \\textbf{dom}~f.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second-order differentiability (informal):** A function $f$ is twice differentiable if its domain is open and the hessian $\\nabla^2 f(x) \\in \\mathbf{S}^n$ $$\\nabla^2 f(x)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2f(x)}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j},~i, j = 1, ..., n,$$ exists at each $x \\in \\textbf{dom}~f$. From this follows a second-order condition for convexity.\n",

    "\\text{strictly convex if }\\nabla^2 f &\\succ 0 \\text{ for all } x \\in \\textbf{dom} f.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note $f$ can be stricly convex and still have $\\nabla^2 f = 0$ for some $x$ - take for example $f(x) = x^4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More examples of convex functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quadratic function:** $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^\\top P x + q^\\top x + r$ for $P \\succ 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least squares objective:** $f(x) = ||Ax - b||_2^2$ for any $A, b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quadratic-over-linear:** $f(x, y) = \\frac{x^2}{y}$ for $y > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**log-sum-exp or soft-max:** $f(x) = \\log \\sum_{n = 1}^N e^{x_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric mean:** $f(x) = \\left(\\prod_{i = 1}^n x_i\\right)^{1/n}$ $x > 0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Epigraphs and sublevel sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sublevel set:** The $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$-sublevel set of $f$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_\\alpha = \\{x \\in \\textbf{dom}~f~|~f(x) \\leq \\alpha \\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the set of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is no larger than $\\alpha$. Sublevel sets of convex functions are convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epigraph:** The epigraph of $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{epi}~f = \\{(x, t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n + 1} | x \\in \\textbf{dom}~f, f(x \\leq t)\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the set of points which are on or above $f$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$.\n",

    "## Jensen's inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convex function:** The definition of a convex function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f\\big(\\theta x + (1 - \\theta)y\\big) \\leq \\theta f(x) + (1 - \\theta)f(y),$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$f\\big(\\mathbb{E}[x]\\big) \\leq \\mathbb{E}\\big[f(x)\\big].$$\n",

    "## Establishing convexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Directly verify definition, for example by restricting to an arbitrary line and showing the restricted function is convex.\n",
    "2. Show Hessian is positive semi-definite.\n",
    "3. Show function can be obtained through a number of operations which preserve convexity.\n",

    "- **Nonnegative multiple:** $\\alpha f$ is convex if $f$ is convex and $\\alpha \\geq 0$.\n",
    "- **Sum:** If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are convex, $f_1 + f_2$ is also convex. This extends to infinite sums and integrals.\n",
    "- **Composition with affine function:** $f(Ax + b)$ is convex if $f$ is convex.\n",
    "- **Pointwise maximum:** If $f_1, f_2, ..., f_n$ are all convex, then $$f(x) = \\max \\{f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_n(x)\\},$$ is convex.\n",
    "- **Pointwise supremum:** If $f(x, y)$ is convex in $x$ for each $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$, then $$\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\sup}{sup} g(x) = \\sup_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}}f(x, y)$$ is also convex.\n",
    "- **Composition with scalar function:** Given functions $g : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $h : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ their composition $$f(x) = h(g(x)),$$ is convex if (1) $g$ is convex, $h$ is convex and $\\tilde{h}$ is nondecreasing; if (2) $g$ is concave, $h$ is convex and $\\tilde{h}$ is nonincreasing.\n",
    "- **Vector composition:** Composition with scalar functions can be extended to composition of vector functions. Suppose Given functions $g : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $h : \\mathbb{R}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}$, then$$f(x) = h\\big(g(x)\\big) = h\\big(g_1(x), g_2(x), ..., g_k(x)\\big),$$ is convex if (1) $g_i$ are all convex, $h$ is convex and $\\tilde{h}$ non-decreasing in each argument; (2) $g_i$ are all concave, $h$ is convex and $\\tilde{h}$ non-increasing in each argument."
