# The C programming language

This is a collection of notes and source taken while reading the book The C
Programming Langage {cite}`cprogkr`. It mainly follows the structure of the
book, supplemented with some additional comments and references that I thoght
was interesting and solutions to the exercises.

The book is great and the best way to learn the language is to read straight
for the book. Perhaps skimming these notes could be a useful supplement, but
their main purpose is to archive my studying and practice with writing.
