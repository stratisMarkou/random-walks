# Random walks ðŸŽ²

This repo and [its website](https://random-walks.org/intro.html) are a way to keep track of the things I study, in a nice format that's accessible from anywhere.
It contains notes and implementations of algorithms that I think are cool and interesting.
If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to get in touch with me or open an issue.
